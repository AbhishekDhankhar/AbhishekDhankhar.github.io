<h1>Causes Of Hair Fall</h1>
<p><h3>1. Nutritional deficiencies</h3>
It could be possible that essential nutrients may be missing from your diets such as iron, copper, zinc and proteins. Deficiency of vitamin D is another cause of hair loss. In order to avoid this, make sure to get out and soak up some sun.
<br><h3>2. Hormonal Imbalance</h3>
After the age of 30, women can experience hormonal imbalance which can cause hair loss. This is usually caused by excessive dihydrotestosterone (DHT) conversion. Even though estrogen is the main hormone that women produce, testosterone and other androgens such as DHEA also occur in the female body. As women reach a certain age, they may begin to convert these androgens to DHT.
<br><h3>3. Thyroid issues</h3>
If the thyroid gland, which is at the front of the neck, produces excessive or an insufficient amount of the thyroid hormone, then the hair growth cycle may change. However, if you do have a thyroid issue, you will notice other symptoms along with hair loss such as weight gain or loss, sensitivity to cold or heat, and changes in heart-rate.
<br><h3>4. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</h3>
Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have a hormonal imbalance which creates higher levels of androgens than normal. This often causes hair to grow on the face and body, while the hair on the head grows thinner. PCOS can also lead to ovulation problems, acne, and weight gain.
<br><h3>5. Birth Control Pills</h3>
Birth control pills can cause hair loss. The hormones in the pill that suppress ovulation can cause hair to thin, especially in women with a family history of hair loss. Sometimes hair loss can occur when you stop taking the pill. Other drugs associated with hair loss are blood thinners and medicines that treat high blood pressure, heart disease, arthritis, and depression.
<br><h3>6. Stress</h3>
Extreme stress can cause sudden hair loss which could last for several months. Minimizing stress through exercise, meditation yoga and massages will reduce your chances of experiencing hair loss.
<br><h3>7. Hairstyling products</h3>
Over-treated hair can lead to hair loss due to the toxic chemicals found in dyes and styling products. Similarly, almost all shampoos contain Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) which has a toxic effect on your immune system and has been proven to corrode hair follicles and impede hair growth. It is advisable to stick to natural shampoos and dyes</p>

<p><h3>1. Shampoo</h3>
It is extremely important to understand your scalp type and choose the right shampoo. Also, you need to wash your hair depending upon your scalp. For instance, over washing hair with dry scalp can lead to hair fall, or not washing oily locks thrice a week can lead to the same.

Further, make sure the shampoo is not loaded with chemicals including sulfate, paraben and silicone that can make your tresses brittle and hence, prone to breakage.
<br><h3>2. Conditioner</h3>
A good conditioner can work wonders for your locks. It contains amino acids that help to repair damaged hair, and also helps to keep them smooth.
<br><h3>3. Diet and Exercise</h3>
You need to feed your hair all the right nutrients particularly plenty of protein and iron. However, along with eating a balanced diet ensure you are exercising side by side. Yoga and meditation are effective in reducing hair fall.
<br><h3>4. Chemical Treatments</h3>
Undergoing rigorous hair treatments like straightening, perming and colouring is definitely not kind to your tresses. Further avoid using blow dryers, curling rods, especially on wet hair as they actually boil the water in your hair shaft and make them brittle.

If you really need to use a blow dry, then keep it on the lowest heat setting. If using other products that heat your hair, start with a fortifying leave-in conditioner and finish with a protective spray.
<br><h3>5. Oiling</h3>
Oiling improves blood circulation and nourishes the roots. Make sure to massage your tresses once a week with oil that suits your scalp. Cover it with a shower cap and wash it off with a mild shampoo after two hours.
<br><h3>6. Too many styling products</h3>
Using too many chemically laden products on your hair could prove harmful in the long run. It’s best to give them a break and try natural home-made recipes instead.</p>
